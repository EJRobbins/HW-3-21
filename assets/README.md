# HW-3-21

Hello there! This is my password generator for the 3/21 assignment. 

First things first, this is obviously not the html/css/javascript provided to the class.
I went ahead and looked into other code pens and other repos to find a more user friendly version.  I much prefer the checkbox to the confirm() method, although the confirm method is relativley simple.  The checkbox simply makes the user experience much more aesthetically pleasing, and centralizes all of the parameters for the password into one place. 

In addition to this, I did want to play with my css a little bit, even though it wasn't the focus of the assignment.  I haven't ever bothered to put a box shadow into any of my previous html, but I found it gave my webpage depth, while still appearing very clean.  I also enjoyed playing around with the pastel colors. All of which I found via w3schools html color picker.

I did receive a comment about using const instead of var for my project.  I definitely understand the risks associated with this, in case I do break something, but felt that everything I listed as a constant is in fact something that will be...well...constant.  There shouldn't ever be a time in which I need to update or re-declare anything listed as const.  I could have used var or let, however, and if need be, I am more than happy to change them. 

Enjoy!
